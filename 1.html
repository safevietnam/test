    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.<br>
    This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,<br>
    enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in<br>
    the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.<br>
    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen,<br>
    in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is<br>
    accessed on a mobile device.<br>
    The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.<br>
    This cascading priority scheme is predictable.<br>
    The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998).<br>
    The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.<br>
